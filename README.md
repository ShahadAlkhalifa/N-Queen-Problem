# N-Queen-Problem

N-Queens problem is based on arranging the queens on a square chessboard, where each queen is placed in a way such that no two queens can attack each other. Queens can attack each other by being in the same row, same column, or same diagonal. The problem takes only one input, which is “N”, and it represents the number of queens on the board and the size of the board N X N. Our problem formulation suggests that the initial state is all queens placed in the first row. It is required to output the goal result, solution cost, search cost, and maximum size of the frontier using BFS, IDS, and A* algorithms.
